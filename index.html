                <h2>A bit about me</h2>
                <p> At 19 I moved to London to study Philosophy at University. 
                    After two years of my course I decided to take time out in order pursue a career opportunity in fashion, working as a model. 
                    For two years I worked full-time travelling to work for clients in Europe. 
                    Eventually I found myself at a complete loss. I felt totally unfulfilled and unaffirmed by work involving uninteresting facts about myself.

                " alt="polaroid of HRMS">
                </div>  
                <p>So I quit, moved back to London, finished my degree, picked up a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0avZZzSMhY" target="_blank">bunson burner</a> to pay rent and lived under the proviso that I was to find my next calling! 
                    After pursuing a few ideas, I was introduced to web development by a friend working in a front-end position. The prospect of working with software excited me tremendously as it offered a plane for so many 
                    of my interests to coincide. A space in which creativity, functionality and ideology co-align.
                </p>
                <p>Inspired by my friend’s self-taught journey, I eagerly searched for the means to kick-start my own. 
                    I was fortunate to swiftly find Founders & Coders.
                    I have since been super grateful for the prerequisites for introducing me to some comprehensive resources and for providing initial structure to my learning.
                </p>
                <p>On top of the work prerequired, I have revisited FCC and have completed many more sections. I continue to use codewars to keep my JS bouyant in my mind and have  
                    taken other courses to bolster my understanding. Anthony Alicea's "Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts" helped ground my fundamental understanding of JS, including two-phased execution context,
                    synchronous exection, scope chain, IIFEs, prototypal inheritance and function constructors. My immediate plan is to finish off Wes Bos' JS30 to further my Vanilla proficiency before trying my hand with work using libraries.

                <p>Outside of code: I have a passion for education, exercise and for food & drink. I am lucky enough tutor some fantastic students ranging from 11+ to A-level and find the work incredibly rewarding. Further, I am also a keen weightlifter and strong proponent of the humbling lessons learnt from physical pursuit.
                    I love to cook (especially for my girlfriend) and to share food with friends. I make a mean Negroni and am a lover of all flavours bitter, tart and/or sharp.

            <div id="F&C" class="tabcontent">
                <h2>A bit about why I like F&C</h2>
                <h3>Principle of reciprocity</h3>
                
                <p>As a Philosophy grad, I am immediately drawn to the conceptual foundation of F&C. A full-stack dev bootcamp is attractive to any
                    self-starting programmer, though what is offered in concept extends beyond this. A typical fee-paying bootcamp, in which one pays upfront for tuition, is a contained transaction, whereas F&C is mutually superior in incentivising a lasting community.   
                </p>
                
                <p>I think it is fantastic that a course driven by principle first exists and I am inspired by a schema that can truly attest to reciprocity between both business & persons.
                    Further, I think that the ethical soundness of F&C's model compliments the philosophical ends of open-source code. Individual flourishing is an inferior end to those attained through true open collaboration, that is, the possibility to make something better than one might possibly achieve alone!
                    I would like to enrol in F&C because I too want the next stage of my learning to be collaborative and  to learn from like-minded individuals. Ultimately, I want to be involved and to contribute towards the perdurance of the course and its ethic.
                </p>
                <h4>∞</h4>                    
                <h3>Peer-led</h3>
                <p>I feel strongly about the effectiveness of peer-to-peer learning. I am excited by the prospect of synergistic learning and ultimately, collaboration! I really like the decentralised nature of the course, where previous cohorts take on an instrumental role in
                    shaping future cohorts learning experiences. In being peer-led, F&C offers vital experience of team-led development, providing invaluable preparation to similar professional contexts. Equally, a course that promises the requisite diversity of perspectives to draw upon, is a course that offers exposure to a variety of values and systems of thought. This to my mind is an inherent good with instrumental value within a development context,
                    as problems will be approached by a bank of ideas more varied, and therefore rich, in experience.  
                </p>
                <h4>∞</h4>
                <h3>Tech for Better</h3>
                <p>Increasingly social media technologies are being scrutinized in terms of the associated social benefits/ risks to children & families. Software-based initiatives like "Breathe With Me" developed by previous F&C members,   
                    I think, exemplify software's capacity to aid presentness, calm and contentment (antonymic to the kinds of effects allegedly precipitated from chronic social media usage).
                    I am keen to become a part of a whole community transparent in its aim to do better with software.
