                <h2>A bit about me</h2>
                <p> At 19 I moved to London to study Philosophy at University. 
                    After two years of my course I decided to take time out in order pursue a career opportunity in fashion, working as a model. 
                    For two years I worked full-time travelling to work for clients in Europe. 
                    Eventually I found myself at a complete loss. I felt totally unfulfilled and unaffirmed by work involving uninteresting facts about myself.

                </div>  
                <p>So I quit, finished my degree, moved back to London, picked up a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0avZZzSMhY" target="_blank">bunson burner</a> to pay rent and lived under the proviso that I was to find my next calling! 
                    After pursuing a few ideas, I was introduced to web development by a friend working in a front-end position. The prospect of working with software excited me tremendously as it offered a plane for so many 
                    of my interests to coincide. A space in which creativity, functionality and ideology coalign.
                </p>
                <p>Inspired by my friendâ€™s self-taught journey, I eagerly searched for the means to kick-start my own. 
                    I was fortunate to swiftly find Founders & Coders.
                    I have since been super grateful for the prerequisites for introducing me to some comprehensive resources and for providing initial structure to my learning.
                </p>
                <p>On top of the work prerequired: I have revisited FCC and have completed many more sections. I continue to use codewars to keep my JS bouyant in my mind and have  
                    taken other courses to bolster my understanding. Anthony Alicea's "Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts" helped ground my fundamental understanding of JS, including two-phased execution context,
                    synchronous exection, scope chain, IIFEs, prototypal inheritance and function constructors. My immediate plan is to finish off Wes Bos' JS30 to further my Vanilla proficiency before trying my hand with work using libraries.
                </p>

                <p>Outside of code: I have a passion for exercise and for food & drink. I am a keen weightlifter and strong proponet of the humbling lessons learnt from physical pursuit.
                    I love to cook (especially for my girlfriend) and to share food with friends. I make a mean Negroni and am a lover of all flavours bitter, tart and/or sharp.
