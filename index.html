                    <h2>A bit about me</h2>
                    <p> At 19 I moved to London to study Philosophy at University. 
                        After two years of my course I decided to take time out in order pursue a career opportunity in fashion, working as a model. 
                        For two years I worked full-time travelling to work for clients in Europe. 
                        Eventually I found myself at a complete loss. I felt totally unfulfilled and unaffirmed by work involving uninteresting facts about myself.

                    </div>  
                    <p>So I quit, finished my degree, moved back to London, picked up a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0avZZzSMhY" target="_blank">bunson burner</a> to pay rent and lived under the proviso that I was to find my next calling! 
                        After pursuing a few ideas, I was introduced to web development by a friend working in a front-end position. The prospect of working with software excited me tremendously as it offered a plane for so many 
                        of my interests to coincide. A space in which a creativity, functionality and ideology intersect.</p>
