                <h2>A bit about me</h2>
                <p> At 19 I moved to London to study Philosophy at University. 
                    At the end of my second year I decided to take time out in order pursue a career opportunity. 
                    For two years I worked full-time as a model for fashion houses in Europe. 
                    Eventually I found myself at a complete loss. I felt totally unfulfilled and unaffirmed by work involving uninteresting facts about myself.

                " alt="polaroid of HRMS">
                </div>  
                <p>So I quit, moved back to London, finished my degree, picked up a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0avZZzSMhY" target="_blank">bunson burner</a> to pay rent and lived under the proviso that I was to find my next calling! 
                    After pursuing a few ideas, I was introduced to web development by a friend working in a front-end position. I was excited to start learning to program and to start to think again as I did when studying predicate (and bits of modal) logic during my degree.    
                  
                </p>
                <p>Inspired by my friend’s self-taught journey, I eagerly searched for the means to kick-start my own. 
                    I was fortunate to swiftly find Founders & Coders.
                    I have since been super grateful for the prerequisites for introducing me to some comprehensive resources and for providing initial structure to my learning.
                </p>
                <p>On top of the work prerequired, I have revisited FCC and have completed many more sections. I continue to use codewars and really benefited from being introduced to TDD through creating a Kata. I completed and frequently revisit  
                     Anthony Alicea's "Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts" which helped ground my fundamental understanding of JS, including it's two-phased execution context,
                    synchronous exection, scope chain, IIFEs, prototypal inheritance and function constructors. My immediate plan is to finish off Wes Bos' JS30 to further my Vanilla proficiency before trying my hand with work using libraries.

                <p>Outside of code: I have a passion for education, exercise and for food & drink. I do part-time tutoring from 11+ to A-level students and derive affirmation from helping secure learning opportunities for others. I am also a keen weightlifter and strong proponent of the humbling lessons learnt from physical pursuit.
                    I love to cook (especially for my girlfriend) and to share food with friends. I make a mean Negroni and am a lover of all flavours bitter, tart and/or sharp.

            <div id="F&C" class="tabcontent">
                <h2>A bit about why I like F&C</h2>
                <h3>Principle of reciprocity</h3>
                
                <p>As a Philosophy grad, I am immediately drawn to the ideological foundation of F&C. A full-stack dev bootcamp is attractive to any
                    self-starting programmer, though what is offered in concept extends beyond this. A typical fee-paying bootcamp, entailing upfront payment for tuition, is a contained service, whereas F&C incentivises a lasting community.   
                </p>
                
                <p>I am inspired by a schema that can truly attest to true reciprocity and it would be a privilege to be contribute to this community.
                    Moreover, I think that the ethical soundness of F&C's model compliments the philosophical ends of open-source code. Individual flourishing is an inferior end to those attained through true open collaboration, that is, the possibility to make something better than one might possibly achieve alone!
                    I am keen to enrol in F&C because I want to be in a environment where learning is accelerated through shared enthusiasm and shared commitment to progression. Ultimately, I want to do good by contributing towards the perdurance of the course and its ethic.
                </p>
                <h4>∞</h4>                    
                <h3>Peer-led</h3>
                <p>I feel strongly about the effectiveness of peer-to-peer learning having conducted peer-run revision clinics for friends during my A-Levels. I am excited by the prospect of synergistic learning and ultimately, collaboration! I am particularly attracted to the involvement of previous cohorts taking on an instrumental role in
                    shaping future cohorts learning experiences. In being peer-led, F&C offers vital experience of team-led development, providing invaluable preparation to similar professional contexts. Equally, a course that promises the requisite diversity of perspectives to draw upon, is a course that offers exposure to a variety of values and systems of thought. This to my mind is an inherent good with instrumental value within a development context,
                    as problems will be approached by a bank of ideas more varied, and therefore more rich, in experience.  
                </p>
                <h4>∞</h4>
                <h3>Tech for Better</h3>
                <p>Increasingly social media technologies are being scrutinized in terms of the associated social benefits/ risks to children & families. Software-based initiatives like "Breathe With Me" developed by previous F&C members,   
                    I think, exemplify software's capacity to aid presentness, calm and contentment (antonymic to the kinds of effects allegedly precipitated from chronic social media usage).
                    I am keen to become a part of a whole transparent and successful in its aim to do better with software.
