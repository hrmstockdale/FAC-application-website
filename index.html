                    <h2>A bit about me</h2>
                    <p>At 19 years old I moved to London to study Philosophy at Kingâ€™s College London. 
                        After two years of my course I decided to take time out to pursue a career opportunity as a model. 
                        For two years I worked full-time travelling for to work for clients within Europe. 
                        By the two-year mark I found myself at a loss. 
                        The prospect of doing another year of modelling presented no further allure and I was fed up with a career that consumed all my time and no longer solicited the affirmation requisite for the kind of fulfilment I was after.
                    </p>

                    </div>  
                    <p>So I quit. Moved back to London, picked up a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0avZZzSMhY" target="_blank">bunson burner</a> for purposes of paying rent and lived under the proviso that I was to find my next calling. 
                        After pursuing a few avenues to varying levels of depth I was introduced to world of code by a friend who had worked his way into a front-end development role. </p>
